# Solutions to Task 06

### 1.Create multiple passwords with varying complexity.    
```
Multiple Passwords:
- Password1!@#
- 1234abcdEFGH
- MySecurePassword2023
- !@#Complexity1234
- Abc123!@#XYZ
```
### 2.Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.
```
Password Variations:
- Simple: password123
- Moderate: Password123!
- Complex: P@ssw0rd!2023
- Very Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G
- Extremely Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G$5H^6I*7J(8K)9L
```
### 3.Test each password on password strength checker.
```
Password Variations @ [Password Strength Checker](https://passwordmeter.com/):
- Simple: password123                               Score: 43% Complexity: Good
- Moderate: Password123!                            Score: 93% Complexity: Very Strong
- Complex: P@ssw0rd!2023                            Score: 100% Complexity: Very Strong 
- Very Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G                      Score: 100% Complexity: Very Strong
- Extremely Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G$5H^6I*7J(8K)9L  Score: 100% Complexity: Very Strong
```
### 4.Note scores and feedback from the tool.
```
For Password @ Simple: password123 
# Feedback [Security.org](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/): It would take a computer about 1 month to crack your password

For Password @ Moderate: Password123!
# Feedback [Security.org](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/): It would take a computer about 34 thousand years to crack your password

For Password @ Complex: P@ssw0rd!2023
# Feedback [Security.org](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/): It would take a computer about 2 million years to crack your password

For Password @ Very Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G
# Feedback [Security.org](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/): It would take a computer about 2 hundred million years to crack your password

For Password @ Extremely Complex: 1A!b2C@d3E#f4G$5H^6I*7J(8K)9L
# Feedback [Security.org](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/): It would take a computer about 4 undecillion years to crack your password

```
### 5.Identify best practices for creating strong passwords.
```
Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
- Use a minimum of 12-16 characters.
- Include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid using easily guessable information (e.g., names, birthdays).
- Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
- Regularly update passwords and change them after security breaches.
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.
```
### 6.Write down tips learned from the evaluation.
```
Tips Learned from Password Evaluation:
- Longer passwords are generally more secure.
- Complexity (mixing character types) significantly increases password strength.
- Avoid common words or phrases to reduce vulnerability to dictionary attacks.
- Use unique passwords for each account to prevent credential stuffing attacks.
- Regularly review and update passwords to maintain security.
```
### 7.Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
```
Common Password Attacks:
- Brute Force Attack: An attacker systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method can be time-consuming but is effective against weak passwords.
- Dictionary Attack: An attacker uses a precompiled list of common passwords or phrases to guess the password. This type of attack exploits the tendency of users to choose weak passwords based on common words or phrases.
- Phishing: An attacker tricks users into revealing their passwords through deceptive emails or websites. This method relies on social engineering rather than technical vulnerabilities.
- Credential Stuffing: An attacker uses stolen username-password pairs from one service to gain access to other accounts where users may have reused the same credentials. This attack takes advantage of the common practice of password reuse.
- Keylogging: An attacker installs malware that records keystrokes, capturing passwords as they are typed. This method can be particularly effective if the user is unaware of the malware's presence.
```
### 8.Summarize how password complexity affects security
```
Password complexity significantly affects security by increasing the difficulty for attackers to guess or crack passwords. Complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters create a larger search space, making brute force attacks less feasible. Additionally, complex passwords are less likely to be found in dictionary attacks, as they do not rely on common words or phrases. Overall, the more complex and unique a password is, the stronger it is against various types of password attacks.
