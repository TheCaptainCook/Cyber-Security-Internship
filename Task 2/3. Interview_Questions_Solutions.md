# Interview Questions:

1.What is phishing?
    Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details. This is often done through deceptive emails or websites that appear trustworthy.
2.How to identify a phishing email?
    To identify a phishing email, look for the following indicators:
    - Generic greetings (e.g., "Dear Customer" instead of your name)
    - Urgent or threatening language urging immediate action
    - Suspicious links or attachments
    - Mismatched sender email addresses
    - Poor grammar and spelling errors
    - Requests for sensitive information
    - Unusual sender domains that do not match the organization’s official domain
3.What is email spoofing?
    Email spoofing is a technique used by attackers to forge the sender's address on an email to make it appear as if it comes from a legitimate source. This is often done to deceive recipients into believing the email is from a trusted entity, thereby increasing the likelihood of them taking harmful actions, such as clicking on malicious links or providing sensitive information.
4.Why are phishing emails dangerous?
    Phishing emails are dangerous because they can lead to various forms of cybercrime, including identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. By successfully deceiving individuals, attackers can gain access to personal accounts, install malware, or compromise organizational security.
5.How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
    Sender authenticity can be verified by:
    - Checking the email address for discrepancies (e.g., misspellings or unusual domains)
    - Looking up the sender's contact information through official channels (e.g., company website)
    - Contacting the sender directly using known contact information, rather than replying to the suspicious email
    - Analyzing email headers to trace the email's origin and verify its legitimacy 
6.What tools can analyze email headers?
    Tools such as:
    - MXToolbox (mxtoolbox.com) - https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx
    - Google’s Message Header Analyzer - https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/
7.What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
    Immediate actions include:
    - Do not click on any links or download attachments
    - Report the email to your organization’s IT or security team
    - Delete the email from your inbox
    - If necessary, block the sender to prevent future emails
    - Educate yourself and others about recognizing phishing attempts to prevent future incidents
8.How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?
    Attackers use social engineering in phishing by manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. They exploit human psychology, often creating a sense of urgency, fear, or curiosity to prompt quick responses without careful consideration. This can involve impersonating trusted entities, using familiar logos, or referencing current events to make the phishing attempt more convincing.
