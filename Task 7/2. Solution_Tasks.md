      - ALFRJANI Mohamed - 5 Stars - literal Perfectionâœ‹ðŸ—¿ðŸ¤š 
      - Michael Martin - 5 Stars - Google destroyed the uBlock Origin because it was too good at allowing you to selectively block content.  They make money off of forcing you to download their ads and so they did away with all the pesky features like the lightening bolt, and eye dropper.  Big shout out to Raymond Hill for his incredible work, and a HUGE middle finger to Google.
      - Martin Gatzweiler (MrGatzi) - 5 stars - works like intended 100/10

#### Unused or Suspicious Extensions: 
1. No unused or suspicious extensions found.

#### Research how malicious extensions can harm users.
Malicious browser extensions can harm users in several ways, including:
1. Data Theft: They can steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data by intercepting web traffic or logging keystrokes.
2. Ad Injection: Some extensions inject unwanted advertisements into web pages, leading to a poor browsing experience and potential exposure to malicious ads.
3. Browser Hijacking: Malicious extensions can change browser settings, such as the homepage or search engine, redirecting users to unwanted sites or search results.
4. Resource Consumption: They can consume excessive system resources, slowing down the browser and overall system performance.
5. Malware Distribution: Some extensions can download and install additional malware on the user's system, leading to further security breaches and data loss.
6. Phishing Attacks: They can create fake login pages or forms to trick users into entering their credentials, which are then sent to attackers.
7. Privacy Violations: Malicious extensions can track user activity, collect browsing habits, and share this information with third parties without the user's consent.
8. Unauthorized Access: They can gain unauthorized access to the user's accounts by manipulating cookies or session data, allowing attackers to impersonate the user or perform actions on their behalf.
9. Persistent Presence: Some malicious extensions can resist removal attempts, making it difficult for users to get rid of them and leaving their systems vulnerable for extended periods.
