# Questions

    1.What is Wireshark used for?
        Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used for capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time. It allows users to inspect the data packets transmitted over a network, providing insights into network performance, troubleshooting issues, and understanding protocol behavior. Wireshark is widely used by network administrators, security professionals, and developers to diagnose network problems, monitor traffic, and ensure compliance with network protocols.
    2.What is a packet?
        Packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. It consists of a header and a payload, where the header contains control information such as source and destination addresses, protocol type, and sequence numbers, while the payload carries the actual data being transmitted. Packets are used to encapsulate and transmit data across networks, enabling efficient communication between devices.
    3.How to filter packets in Wireshark?
        We can filter packets in Wireshark using display filters, which allow users to specify criteria for viewing specific packets of interest. Filters can be applied based on various attributes such as IP addresses, protocols, ports, and packet contents. For example, to filter packets from a specific IP address, you can use the filter expression `ip.addr == 192.168.0.171`. To filter packets by protocol, you can use expressions like `tcp`, `udp`, or `http`. Wireshark also supports complex filters that combine multiple criteria using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT). Filters can be entered in the display filter bar at the top of the Wireshark interface, allowing users to quickly narrow down the displayed packets to those relevant to their analysis.
    4.What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are both transport layer protocols used for data transmission over networks. The key differences between them are:
        - **Connection-oriented vs. Connectionless**: TCP is connection-oriented, meaning it establishes a reliable connection before data transfer, ensuring that packets are delivered in order and without errors. UDP is connectionless, allowing data to be sent without establishing a connection, which can result in faster transmission but without guarantees of delivery or order.
        - **Reliability**: TCP provides error checking, retransmission of lost packets, and flow control, making it reliable for applications that require accurate data delivery. UDP does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction, making it suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability, such as streaming media or online gaming.
        - **Header Size**: TCP headers are larger due to additional fields for managing connections and ensuring reliability, while UDP headers are smaller and simpler, containing only essential information for packet delivery.
        - **Use Cases**: TCP is commonly used for applications that require reliable communication, such as web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), and file transfers (FTP). UDP is used for applications that prioritize speed and can tolerate some data loss, such as video streaming (RTSP), voice over IP (VoIP), and online gaming.
    5.What is a DNS query packet?
        DNS (Domain Name System) query packet is a type of network packet used to request the resolution of a domain name into its corresponding IP address. When a client (such as a web browser) needs to access a website, it sends a DNS query packet to a DNS server, asking for the IP address associated with the domain name. The DNS server processes the request and responds with the appropriate IP address, allowing the client to establish a connection to the desired server.
    6.How can packet capture help in troubleshooting?
        Capturing packets can significantly aid in troubleshooting network issues by providing detailed insights into the data being transmitted across the network. By analyzing packet captures, network administrators can identify problems such as:
        - Network congestion or bottlenecks by examining traffic patterns and flow.
        - Misconfigured devices or protocols by inspecting packet headers and payloads.
        - Connectivity issues by checking for lost or delayed packets and analyzing round-trip times.
        - Security incidents by detecting unusual traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or malicious activity.
        Packet captures allow for a granular view of network behavior, enabling administrators to pinpoint the root cause of issues and implement effective solutions.
    7.What is a protocol?
        Protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication between devices in a network. It defines how data is formatted, transmitted, and interpreted, ensuring that devices can understand each other and exchange information effectively. Protocols specify various aspects of communication, including message structure, error handling, flow control, and addressing. Common examples of protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web communication, TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for internet communication, and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers.
    8.Can Wireshark decrypt encrypted traffic?
        No, Wireshark cannot decrypt encrypted traffic by itself. However, it can analyze encrypted packets if the necessary decryption keys or certificates are provided. For example, if SSL/TLS traffic is captured, Wireshark can decrypt it if the user has access to the private key or the session keys used during the encryption process. Without these keys, Wireshark will only display the encrypted data, making it impossible to analyze the contents of the packets.
