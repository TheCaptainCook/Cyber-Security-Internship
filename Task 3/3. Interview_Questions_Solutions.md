# Interview Questions:

1.What is vulnerability scanning?
    Vulnerability scanning is the process of systematically identifying and assessing security weaknesses in a system, network, or application. It involves using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other security issues that could be exploited by attackers. The goal is to discover potential security risks before they can be exploited.
2.Difference between vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
    Vulnerability scanning is an automated process that identifies known vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. It provides a list of potential security issues based on a database of known vulnerabilities. Penetration testing, on the other hand, is a manual or semi-automated process where security professionals simulate real-world attacks to exploit vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security measures. While vulnerability scanning focuses on identifying potential issues, penetration testing goes further by attempting to exploit those vulnerabilities to determine their impact and risk level.
3.What are some common vulnerabilities in personal computers?
    Common vulnerabilities in personal computers include:
    - Unpatched software: Outdated operating systems and applications that have not been updated with the latest security patches.
    - Weak passwords: Using easily guessable or default passwords for user accounts and services.
    - Misconfigured settings: Incorrectly configured security settings that leave systems exposed to attacks.
    - Malware infections: Presence of malicious software that can compromise system integrity and steal sensitive information.
    - Open ports: Unsecured network ports that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
    - Lack of antivirus or antimalware protection: Absence of security software to detect and prevent malicious activities.
4.How do scanners detect vulnerabilities?
    Scanners detect vulnerabilities by performing a series of automated checks against the target system or application. They use a database of known vulnerabilities and security best practices to identify potential issues. The scanning process typically involves:
    - Network discovery: Identifying active devices and services on the network.
    - Port scanning: Checking for open ports and services running on those ports.
    - Service enumeration: Gathering information about the services running on identified ports.
    - Vulnerability assessment: Comparing the gathered information against a database of known vulnerabilities to identify potential security issues.
    - Reporting: Generating a report that lists identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommended remediation steps.
5.What is CVSS?
    CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized framework used to assess the severity of vulnerabilities in software and systems. It provides a numerical score (ranging from 0 to 10) that reflects the potential impact and exploitability of a vulnerability. The CVSS score is calculated based on several factors, including:
    - Base metrics: Characteristics of the vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments (e.g., access vector, complexity, impact).
    - Temporal metrics: Characteristics that change over time (e.g., availability of exploit code, remediation level).
    - Environmental metrics: Characteristics that are specific to a user's environment (e.g., security requirements, collateral damage potential).
    The CVSS score helps organizations prioritize vulnerabilities based on their risk level and make informed decisions about remediation efforts.
6.How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
    Vulnerability scans should be performed regularly to ensure ongoing security. The frequency of scans can vary based on the organization's risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and the criticality of the systems being scanned. Common practices include:
    - Monthly scans for high-risk systems or critical infrastructure.
    - Quarterly scans for less critical systems.
    - After significant changes to the network or system configurations (e.g., new deployments, software updates).
    - Continuous monitoring for real-time detection of vulnerabilities in dynamic environments.
    Regular scanning helps identify new vulnerabilities and ensures that existing ones are addressed promptly.
7.What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning?
    Vulnerability scanning false positives occur when a scanner incorrectly identifies a vulnerability that does not actually exist in the target system. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:
    - Misconfigured scanning tools that misinterpret the target's response. 
    - Outdated vulnerability databases that contain incorrect or irrelevant information.
    - Variations in system configurations that lead to false alarms.
    False positives can lead to wasted resources and time spent investigating non-existent vulnerabilities, so it is essential to validate findings through manual verification or additional testing.
8.How do you prioritize vulnerabilities?
    We prioritize vulnerabilities based on several factors, including:
    - Severity: Using the CVSS score to assess the potential impact and exploitability of each vulnerability.
    - Asset criticality: Evaluating the importance of the affected system or application to the organization.
    - Exploitability: Considering whether the vulnerability is actively being exploited in the wild or if there are known exploits available.
    - Business impact: Assessing the potential consequences of a successful exploit on the organization's operations, reputation, and data security.
    - Regulatory requirements: Taking into account any compliance obligations that may dictate the prioritization of certain vulnerabilities.
    By combining these factors, we can create a risk-based approach to vulnerability management, focusing on the most critical issues first to reduce the overall risk to the organization.
