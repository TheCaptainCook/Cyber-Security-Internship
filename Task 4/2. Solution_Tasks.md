```
## Rule Addition

Add a rule to block inbound traffic on a specific port (e.g., 23 for Telnet)

1.  Images 1.4 - Image 1.8 - Rule Addition

## Remove Rule 

Remove a rule that allows inbound traffic on a specific port (e.g., 23 for Telnet)

```bash
Remove-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Telnet"
```

## Summarize how firewall filters traffic
    Firewall filters traffic by applying a set of predefined rules that determine whether to allow or block incoming and outgoing network packets. These rules can be based on various criteria, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocols, and the direction of the traffic (inbound or outbound). By inspecting each packet against these rules, the firewall can enforce security policies, prevent unauthorized access, and protect the network from potential threats. Firewalls can also log traffic for monitoring and analysis purposes, helping administrators identify suspicious activity and respond to security incidents effectively.
